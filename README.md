# Medical-Converter
A Python Program I created for DocAssist, a medical startup. The program automatically converts data collected from different medical case studies into a format that is easily readable by both doctors and a program.

##Manual Requirements

The program does almost everything automatically. However, there are some manual requirements. These include:
- Manually making sure entrance csv file is readable by program (Top line matches "row" variable in program.
- Manually enter Sheet Source name into program; Due to the way it is structured, it cannot automatically read this.

Everything else is automatically converted.

If you would like me to make a similar program for your company, please contact me at sidharthmrao@gmail.com

This repo contains the code, an example of an input file, and an example of an output.
